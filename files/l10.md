# Knowledge Representation

Let us again consider the MopBot example. Remember, our MopBot has: Our mopbot has:
- Sensors, which enables it to detect whether there is dirt in the room.
- Actuators, which enables it to clean the room or move to another room.
  
Suppose, we want to tell that MopBot should clean the room B and come back to room A. It might develop the following simple plan p1 to achieve the goal:

1. Move to B.
2. Clean B.
3. Leave B when no dirt is detected.
   
Alternatively, the MopBot may also adopt a more complex plan p2 to achieve the goal: 

1. Move to B.
2. If dirt is detected, clean B. Otherwise, there is no need to clean.
3. Leave B when no dirt is detected.
   
Here, MopBot had known two things:

- No dirt detected when room is clean.
- Leave room B when No dirt detected.
  
From above two statements, we want MopBot to have knowledge of leave room B when room is clean, in other-words, we want the MopBot to somehow store this knowledge.

## 10.1 Propositional logic
Knowledge is a concept that is very hard to define, but one definition of knowledge that has been generally agreed upon is: An agent A knows that statement S is true if and only if:

1. S is true.
2. A believes S is true.
3. A is justified in believing that S is true.

We will now introduce the idea of propositions, which are variables that take on values True or False. We can decide whether or not we can make such deductions by replacing these statements with propositions. For instance, assume
- g represent Greeks,
- h represent Humans,
- m represent Mortals.
