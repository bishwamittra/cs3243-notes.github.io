# Knowledge Representation

Let us again consider the MopBot example. Remember, our MopBot has:
- Sensors, which enables it to detect whether there is dirt in the room.
- Actuators, which enables it to clean the room or move to another room.
  
Suppose, we want to tell that MopBot should clean the room *B* and come back to room *A*. It might develop the following simple plan $$p_1$$ to achieve the goal:

1. Move to *B*.
2. Clean *B*.
3. Leave *B* when no dirt is detected.
   
Alternatively, the MopBot may also adopt a more complex plan $$p_2$$ to achieve the goal: 

1. Move to *B*.
2. If dirt is detected, clean *B*. Otherwise, there is no need to clean.
3. Leave *B* when no dirt is detected.
   
Here, MopBot had known two things:

- No dirt detected when room is clean.
- Leave room *B* when no dirt detected.
  
From above two statements, we want MopBot to have knowledge of leave room *B* when room is clean, in other-words, we want the MopBot to somehow store this knowledge.

## 10.1 Propositional logic
Knowledge is a concept that is very hard to define, but one definition of knowledge that has been generally agreed upon is: An agent *A* knows that statement *S* is true if and only if:

1. *S* is true.
2. *A* believes *S* is true.
3. *A* is justified in believing that *S* is true.

$~~~~$We will now introduce the idea of $$propositions$$, which are variables that take on values $$True$$ or $$False$$. We can decide whether or not we can make such deductions by replacing these statements with propositions. For instance, assume
- $$g$$ represent Greeks,
- $$h$$ represent Humans,
- $$m$$ represent Mortals.

<div align="center">
All greeks are human. $~~~~~$| $~$ $g$ → $h$ <br /> 
All humans are mortal. $~~~~~$| $~$ $h$ → $m$ <br /> 
<hr align ="center" style="border: 0.3px solid black; width:40%; margin:0px;">
All greeks are mortal. $~~~~~~$| $~$ $g$ → $m$
<hr align ="center" style="border: 1px solid black; width:40%; margin:0px">
</div>
<br />
$~~~~$The problem is in general we can not differentiate between whether statement *S* is true or Agent *A* believes that *S* is true. With the statements “all Greeks are human” and “all humans are mortal”, we can deduce that “all Greeks are mortal”. However, with “not all Greeks are human” and “all humans are mortal”, we are not able to deduce that “not all Greeks are mortal”.

<div align="center">
Not all greeks are human. $~~~~~$| $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$<br /> 
All humans are mortal. $~~~~~~$| $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$<br /> 
<hr align ="center" style="border: 0.3px solid black; width:50%; margin:0px;">
Not all greeks are mortal. $~~~~~$| $~$ can’t deduce
<hr align ="center" style="border: 1px solid black; width:50%; margin:0px">
</div>
<br />

$~~~~$After introducing propositions, we need a way of combining them to construct meaningful sentences.
This led to the introduction of operators, including:
- unary operators: $¬$ (Negation)
- binaryoperations: $∧$ and $∨$, $a→b≡¬a∨b$

Finally, we would want to be able to express our knowledge base($$KB$$). The language of Knowledge base:
- $$PROP$$: the set of all propositions, and
- $$FORM$$: the set of all formulas/sentences that can be expressed by propositional logic.

Using these expressions, we will be able to classify which statements are allowed in propositional logic, and which are not allowed. For instance, $$(p ∨ q)$$ is allowed under $$PROP$$ and $$FORM$$, whereas $$(p ∧ q)$$ is not allowed. $$FORM$$ can be recursively defined as such:

$$~~~~~~~~~~FORM_0 = PROP$$ <br />
$$~~~~~~FORM_{i+1} = FORM_i ∪ \{(α ◦ β)|α, β ∈ FORM_i\} ∪ \{(¬α)|α ∈ FORM_i\}$$
$$~~~~~~~~~~~~FORM = \bigcup\limits_{i=0}^{\infty}  FORM_i $$ <br />

where $$α ◦ β ≡ \{(α ∨ β)\} ∨ \{(α ∧ β)\}$$. Every $$α ∈ KB$$ is also in $$FORM$$. <br />
$~~~~$Every formula $$φ$$ may be true or false depending on the situation. For example: $$p ∨ q$$ is true when
$$p=0$$ and $$q=1$$, but false when $$p=0$$, $$q=0$$. Here, we define the notion of truth assignment $$τ$$.

<center>$$τ : PROP →\{0,1\}$$</center>

If a formula $$φ$$ is true in $$τ$$, we say $$τ \models φ$$. To check whether $$τ \models φ$$ or not, we can substitute every propositional variables with its truth assignment, and if $$φ$$ evaluates to true then $$τ \models φ$$ else not.

<center>$τ \models φ$ iff $φ ( τ ) = 1$</center>
where $$φ(τ)$$ is $$φ$$ after substituting propositions of $$φ$$ with their values in $$τ$$.
